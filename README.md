# 🎓 Student Performance and Financial Habit Analysis  

**Tools Used:** Excel | SQL | Python | Power BI  

---

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project explores the relationship between **students’ financial habits** and their **academic performance** using three datasets — `student_financial_data`, `academic_data`, and `demographics_data`.  

The goal was to discover whether financial discipline and spending behavior influence academic success.  
Using **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI**, I built a full analytical workflow — from data cleaning and merging to exploration and visualization.

## 🧩 Data Preparation (Excel)
- Explored three datasets and checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- Merged all data using **XLOOKUP** into one master dataset.  
- Added calculated fields:
  - `Total_Expenses`
  - `Savings`
  - `Expense_to_Income_Ratio`
- Used **PivotTables** for preliminary charts (bar and pie charts).

## 💾 Data Exploration (SQL)
Key insights from SQL analysis:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Average Income** | ₦75,995.21 |
| **Average Expense** | ₦38,569.51 |
| **Average Savings** | ₦37,425.70 |
| **Expense-to-Income Ratio** | 53% |

**By Academic Level:**  
- 200 Level students earned the most (₦77,294.18) and saved the most (₦38,257.08).  
- 500 Level students had the highest expense-to-income ratio (0.53).  

**By Gender:**  
- Females earned more (₦76,529.29) and saved more (₦38,192.57).  
- Males spent more (₦38,918.70).  

**By Month:**  
- June recorded the highest average income (₦77,241.30), expenses (₦39,705.80), and savings (₦39,708.80).  

**By Residence:**  
- Off-campus students spent more (₦38,850.60) and had a GPA of 3.39.  
- On-campus students spent less (₦37,551.74) but had a slightly higher GPA of 3.41.

## 🐍 Data Validation & Visualization (Python)
Using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**:  
- Confirmed SQL findings programmatically.  
- Created bar, line, and distribution plots showing spending and saving trends by gender, level, and residence type.  
- Validated average income, expenses, and savings consistency across all tools.

---

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
Built an interactive dashboard including:
- **KPI Cards:** Total income, total expenses, total savings, and their averages.  
- **Pie Chart:** Income distribution by gender.  
- **Custom Column Chart:** Income vs expenses by level.  
- **Bar Chart:** Spending by residence type.  
- **Line Chart:** Income and expense trend over time.

## 💡 Key Insights
1. Students with higher savings generally maintain better GPAs.  
2. Off-campus students spend more due to additional living costs.  
3. Females earn and save more, while males spend more.  
4. Academic level affects spending and saving patterns.  
5. High-income months show proportional increases in savings and expenses.

## 🧭 Reflection
My goal with this project was to understand how students’ financial habits could influence academic performance.  

Through this dataset, I explored how factors like **residence type**, **gender**, and **academic level** affect spending and saving patterns.  

The process deepened my technical and storytelling skills — proving that behind every number is a human decision, and behind every dataset, a story waiting to be told.
